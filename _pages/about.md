I am a Ph.D. student in the [Data Integration and Data Preparation group of TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/d2ip) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ziawasch Abedjan](https://www.bifold.berlin/people/prof-dr-ziawasch-abedjan.html). I have received my M. Sc. degree from University Duisburg-Essen. I worked on predicting the success of web search as my Master's Thesis.

My research interest is in data discovery and integration. More specifically, I develop systems for accurate data transformation discovery from different data sources and enable an accurate data transformation for complex transformation types.
